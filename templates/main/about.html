        <p style="margin: 0 0 0px !important;font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Slabo 27px';">WHY SOLAR?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: 'Slabo 27px';font-style: italic">Thomas Edison once said “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that. I wish I had more years left.”</p>
        <p>A majority of our planet’s electricity supply is being generated from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. These energy sources are staring at irreversible and damaging issues, including rising prices, security concerns, over dependence on imports from a limited number of countries and growing environmental concerns about the climate. Topping this list is the fact that these resources are finite and are depleting fast. It’s not a question of ‘if’, it’s a question of ‘when’.</p>
        <p>Today, the time has come when humanity has to tackle two critical challenges – meeting the ever growing global energy needs and fighting global warming for a better tomorrow.</p>
